"""
This problem was asked by Slack. (MEDIUM)

You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner,
how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1
represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

    Right, down, down, right
    Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0
