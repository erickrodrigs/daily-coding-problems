This problem was asked by Square. (MEDIUM)

Given a list of words, return the shortest unique prefix of each word.
For example, given the list: ["dog", "cat", "apple", "apricot", "fish"]
Return the list: ["d", "c", "app", "apr", "f"]

"""
SOLUTION:
n = len(word_list)

- time complexity: O(n * len(longest_word)), since we do an
internal loop for all words until they are all prefixed, which
can be done len(longest_word) times. All other loops inside the
'while loop' of the line 24 are linear and the other internal
operations are done in constant time (accessing dictionary and set)

- space complexity: O(n * len(longest_word))
